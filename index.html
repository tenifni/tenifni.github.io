    <p> Salve! You've reached my personal website. I am a current student at the <i>University of California Los Angeles</i>. I spend 3/4 of my day lingering in PAB basement or Knudsen Hall, so you may find me there with the highest probability. <br>Below is a subset of my academic record since start of college.</p>

        <h3>1. <a href="http://campbellgroup.physics.ucla.edu/">Campbell Group</a>, UCLA. October 2016 - Present</h3>

                    Demonstration of a stimulated force technique using Rb atoms for direct deceleration of molecules.
                    </p>

                    </li>
                Despite the success with ultra-cold atoms, molecules are far more difficult to Doppler cool due to their many internal degrees of freedom. Conventional laser slowing for molecules, which relies on effective cycling of photons, require numerous additional repump lasers. To circumvent the dark-state decay problem in molecules, an all-optical deceleration scheme is proposed, in which a stimulated force is created from first exciting a molecular beam with a counter-propagating ``pump" pulse via stimulated absorption, and immediately de-exciting the molecules with a co-propagating ``dump pulse" via stimulated emission. 
                <br>As a proof of principle, we benchmark this stimulated force by accelerating rubidium (Rb) neutral atoms.</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. <a href="http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/haeffner/index.html">Haeffner Group</a>, UC Berkeley. June - September 2018 (as UC LEADS Scholar) </h3>
            <p><b>PI</b>: Hartmut Haeffner. <b>Mentors</b>: Dr. Eli Megidish, and Dr. Weiting Chen</p>
             <ul>
                <li> 
                    <p>
                        Compact free-space AOM modules for scalable trapped-ion quantum simulations
                    </p>
                    The motivation of this project stems from the aspect of demonstrating scalability of trapped-ion platform for quantum information processing. 
                    To date, all rudimentary processes in trapped-ion quantum computing--initialization, quantum gate operation, and readout of qubits --have been achieved efficiently by many experiments. 
                    However, scaling up to larger number of ions in a trap and performing single-ion manipulations is still of great experimental difficulty.  
                    As several lasers of different wavelengths are needed for laser-ion interactions involved in all these processes, a key in achieving scalability of addressing single ions for shuttling and gate operations is having compact, modular setups to control the lasers in MHz regime.  
                    A widely-used technology for modulating frequency and switching lasers  is acousto-optic modulators (AOM). Thus, we benchmark several compact fiber-in/out AOM modules used for 729nm light control in <sup>40</sup>Ca<sup>+</sup> ion trapping experiment.

                        Developing a means of diffusion for vibrotactile music -- a form of music that can be felt as vibration on one’s skin. 
                        <p>
                        The study’s goal is to develop a platform for
                        vibrotactile music composition and delivery.
                        Given we define music as a temporal
                        structure, through vibrotactile simulation, we
                        investigate different inter-sensorial illusions of
                        movement that may convey musical form. <br>
                        Using a multichannel array of tactile actuators placed at
                        distinct points on the a person's arm, we test a
                        range of perceptual effects that is particular to a
                        given spatial configuration on the human body.
                        We then develop the most effective wearable
                        devices to deliver these effects to the body. The
                        designs of these wearable prototypes are
                        further tested and refined to serve within in a
                        vibrotactile musical system where a user wearing
                        the device receives tactile feedback in
                        combination with sound and visuals.
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simply put, I designed and built wearable prototypes using Form-Z (CAD) and a 3D printer. Composed and delivered C++ code to mechanical actuators to produce tactile musical notes.
