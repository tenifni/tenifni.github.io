                    Despite the success with ultra-cold atoms, molecules are far more difficult to Doppler cool due to their many internal degrees of freedom. 
                    Conventional laser slowing for molecules, which relies on effective cycling of photons, require numerous additional repump lasers. 
                    To circumvent the dark-state decay problem in molecules, an all-optical deceleration scheme is proposed, in which a stimulated force is created from first exciting a molecular beam with a counter-propagating ``pump" pulse via stimulated absorption, and immediately de-exciting the molecules with a co-propagating ``dump pulse" via stimulated emission. 
                    <br>As a proof of principle, we benchmark this stimulated force by accelerating rubidium (Rb) neutral atoms.</a></li>

                Current Senior Thesis: <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP19/Session/S01.108">Surface-bond molecules functionalized with optical cycling centers </a>
                </p>
                Repeatable, state-selective optical transitions are widely used for state preparation and measurement of qubits hosted by trapped atoms. 
                Due to the vibrational structure that is introduced when trying to apply this technique to molecules, optical cycling is typically unavailable.  
                Inspired by the recent experimental demonstrations on laser cooling of polyatomic molecules that contain an Optical Cycling Center (OCC) in the form of a bonded alkaline earth atom, we propose building a candidate quantum system consisting of assembled monovalent molecules of alkaline-earth (AE)-oxide that are bond to a surface. 
                These surface-bond molecules will be functionalized with alkaline earth OCCs to endow them with the ability for fast and high-fidelity qubit operations and <i>in-situ </i> coherent transport of quantum information.

                            Compact free-space AOM modules for scalable trapped-ion quantum simulations
                        </p>
                        The motivation of this project stems from the aspect of demonstrating scalability of trapped-ion platform for quantum information processing. 
                        To date, all rudimentary processes in trapped-ion quantum computing--initialization, quantum gate operation, and readout of qubits --have been achieved efficiently by many experiments. 
                        However, scaling up to larger number of ions in a trap and performing single-ion manipulations is still of great experimental difficulty.  
                        As several lasers of different wavelengths are needed for laser-ion interactions involved in all these processes, a key in achieving scalability of addressing single ions for shuttling and gate operations is having compact, modular setups to control the lasers in MHz regime.  
                        We benchmark several compact fiber-in/out  acousto-optic modulators (AOM) (widely-used for modulating frequency and switching lasers) modules used for 729nm light control in <sup>40</sup>Ca<sup>+</sup> ion trapping experiment.

                            Developing a means of diffusion for vibrotactile music -- a form of music that can be felt as vibration on one’s skin. 
                            <p>
                            The study’s goal is to develop a platform for
                            vibrotactile music composition and delivery.
                            Given we define music as a temporal
                            structure, through vibrotactile simulation, we
                            investigate different inter-sensorial illusions of
                            movement that may convey musical form. <br>
                            Using a multichannel array of tactile actuators placed at
                            distinct points on the a person's arm, we test a
                            range of perceptual effects that is particular to a
                            given spatial configuration on the human body.
                            We then develop the most effective wearable
                            devices to deliver these effects to the body. The
                            designs of these wearable prototypes are
                            further tested and refined to serve within in a
                            vibrotactile musical system where a user wearing
                            the device receives tactile feedback in
                            combination with sound and visuals.
